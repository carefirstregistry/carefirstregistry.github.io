            <p class="questiontitle">How does Care First Registry differ from Rose’s Agency?</p>
            <p class="questionanswer">We offer a third party payroll company that will invoice you and pay the caregiver.
                You do not have to pay the caregiver or the agency fee directly.
                They take care of paying the caregiver you chose, they will 1099 them at the end of the year.
                This means you write one check to the payroll company for everything and reduces the amount of 
                time you spend on  bookkeeping.</p>

                <p class="questiontitle">How does the process work?</p>
                <p class="questionanswer">We seek independent housekeepers to register with our company. 
                With our many years of experience, we have a big pool of tried and true caregivers. 
                After vetting new and previously used caregivers, we match them up with clients who meet 
                their needs perfectly. Using ou registry will save you the time of having to locate and 
                screen housekeepers.</p>

    <button class="accordion">When are the housekeepers available?
        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>You determine directly with the housekeeper which hours and days you want the them to come.
        As a rule of thumb most of the jobs are performed Monday through Friday from 8am to 6pm. 
        We do have housekeepers who are available 7 days a week.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What do I need to provide?
        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Some housekeepers bring their own supplies for your convenience. Some housekeepers do not bring supplies 
        because the household prefers specific cleaning products and methods for cleaning. 
        This should be discussed when hiring the housekeeper.
        Generally, the Client will pay for the cleaning products they prefer used in their home. 
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">How do I pay?
        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>The payroll company we use accepts all major credit cards for your convenience. You can pay the 
        housekeeper directly for services with cash or a check. In accordance with California law, Client 
        Fees collected by Care First REgistry are deposited into a Trust Account until the Housekeeper is paid.

    <div class="panel">
    <p> If you are pleased with the first housekeeper referred to you, then he or she 
        can provide regular recurring services. You can request another housekeeper 
        if you aren’t completely satisfied with who was chosen. We suggest that you schedule repeat 
        service based on your favorite housekeeper’s schedule and availability.

    <p>California Required Disclosure: Care First Registry is not the employer of the domestic worker it

        manner and means by which the domestic worker performs his or her work, you may have 
        employer responsibilities, including employment taxes and workers compensation, under

    <p>If you believe something is missing from your home, please discuss this with all members of the household to confirm the item is lost. 
        Once you are convinced the item is missing, Care First Registry management encourages you to notify your local police department 
        to investigate the matter. Care First Registry will cooperate with law enforcement in any investigation.
        With regard to damage, the referred housekeeper is independent and therefore responsible for damage.
